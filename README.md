Welcome to my **100 Days of Code - Python** repository! This repository contains all the projects and code I've written as part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. The goal of this challenge was to improve my Python programming skills by coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days.

## üìå Overview

- **Duration**: 100 Days
- **Language**: Python
- **Instructor**: Harry (from CodeWithHarry)
- **Goal**: To build a strong foundation in Python and develop various projects to apply the concepts learned.

## üöÄ Projects

Here‚Äôs a list of projects I‚Äôve completed during the challenge:

1. **Day 63 - [Snake Water Gun]**
